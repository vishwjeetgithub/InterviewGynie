By interacting with the bot, users can refine their skills, understand areas for improvement, and better prepare for actual job interviews in the data science field.\n","\n","**System Design:**\n","The system initiates with a welcome message that sets the stage for interaction. It then uses intent clarification to determine the user's focus area. Based on the input, the system extracts relevant assessment criteria from a predefined dataset, formulating questions that target the user’s specified competencies. Responses are evaluated by the bot, which acts as both invigilator and evaluator, ensuring responses align with professional standards. Additionally, all user interactions are monitored via a moderation function to maintain the appropriateness of content. This structure not only supports a dynamic and engaging learning environment but also incorporates critical aspects of real-world AI applications, such as ethical usage and data handling.\n","\n","Through coding and implementing this chatbot, you'll explore the integration of AI in educational tools, enhance your programming skills, and understand the intricacies of system design that supports both user engagement and pedagogical effectiveness."],"metadata":{"id":"LbPFQHxevHaM"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Introduction\n","Our project focuses on creating a chatbot that acts as a virtual interviewer for data science job seekers.

This enables businesses to offer personalized marketing and sales campaigns that increase customer engagement and loyalty23.

Provide examples of how companies utilize distributed and cloud computing technologies to process, store, and analyze large volumes of data efficiently.\n","Distributed Computing is a model in which components of a software system are shared among multiple computers to improve efficiency and performance1. In the context of big data, distributed computing allows for the processing and analysis of large volumes of data across multiple machines, making it possible to handle data that would be too large for a single machine21.  Cloud Computing, on the other hand, is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources3. It provides the infrastructure to store and process large amounts of data in a cost-effective and efficient manner3.  In the context of big data ecosystems, distributed and cloud computing paradigms are often combined. Big data platforms typically utilize distributed storage systems that can handle large volumes of data. These systems include Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), Google Cloud Storage, or Amazon S34. This distributed storage architecture ensures high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability4.  Here are some examples of how companies utilize these technologies:  Netflix: Netflix is a trailblazer when it comes to microservices. The company efficiently serves nearly 100 million users and deploys new code on a daily basis. They use a form of hybrid cloud computing to harness their data, connect trillions of points, and produce new solutions5.

Cloud Computing, on the other hand, is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources3. It provides the infrastructure to store and process large amounts of data in a cost-effective and efficient manner3.  In the context of big data ecosystems, distributed and cloud computing paradigms are often combined. Big data platforms typically utilize distributed storage systems that can handle large volumes of data. These systems include Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), Google Cloud Storage, or Amazon S34. This distributed storage architecture ensures high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability4.  Here are some examples of how companies utilize these technologies:  Netflix: Netflix is a trailblazer when it comes to microservices. The company efficiently serves nearly 100 million users and deploys new code on a daily basis. They use a form of hybrid cloud computing to harness their data, connect trillions of points, and produce new solutions5. Airbnb and Uber: Much like Netflix, Airbnb and Uber also use a form of hybrid cloud computing to harness their data and connect trillions of points'}\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Evaluator function\n","Generates an evaluation report based on the responses provided by the user."],"metadata":{"id":"Bwd4FHNaVexS"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# @title #### Code\n","def evaluator(responses):\n","    '''\n","    Returns a list of prompts [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_message}]\n","    '''\n","\n","    delimiter = \"####\"\n","\n","    system_message = f'''\n","    You are an intelligent evaluator who generates a proper evaluation report based on the responses for the corresponding questions from {responses}.\n","    You have to provide a rating being 'excellent', 'satisfactory' or 'poor' for each response, Then a brief feedback for all responses at once.\n","    Do not provide feedback for each question one by one.

Please provide an example or case study to illustrate this process.\n","Sure, let’s consider a real-world example of how Netflix turns data insights into business value:  Netflix, the world’s leading streaming entertainment service, leverages big data and distributed computing technologies to process, store, and analyze large volumes of data. They collect a vast amount of data from their nearly 100 million users, including viewing history, search queries, ratings, and even the time and date of playbacks.  Netflix uses this data to gain insights into user behavior and preferences. These insights are then used to personalize the viewing experience for each user, recommend content, and even influence the production of new content. For instance, by analyzing viewing patterns, Netflix can identify which genres or actors are most popular among its users. This information can then be used to guide the production of new Netflix Original series or movies.  In addition to personalization, Netflix also uses big data for quality control and optimization. For example, they analyze data from different devices to understand how streaming quality varies and make necessary adjustments.  This is a great example of how data insights can be turned into business value. By leveraging big data, Netflix has been able to improve the user experience, increase viewer engagement, and make more informed decisions about content production.\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Question: Can you explain how you would adapt your final deliverables and presentations based on the audience, whether they are data scientists or business stakeholders? Provide specific examples of adjustments you would make for each type of audience.\n","Absolutely, tailoring communication based on the audience is crucial for effective data storytelling. Here’s how I would adapt my presentations for different audiences:  1. Data Scientists:  For data scientists, I would focus on the technical aspects of the project. This could include:  Data Exploration: Discuss the nature of the data, missing values, outliers, and how these were handled. Model Selection: Explain why a particular model was chosen over others. Discuss the assumptions, benefits, and limitations of the model. Feature Engineering: Discuss the creation of new variables and why they were expected to improve the model. Model Evaluation: Present metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curves, etc., to evaluate the model’s performance. For example, if I were presenting a machine learning model that predicts customer churn, I might discuss the preprocessing steps, the reason for choosing a logistic regression model, the creation of interaction variables, and the model’s performance metrics.  2. Business Stakeholders:  For business stakeholders, I would focus on the business impact and actionable insights. This could include:  Problem Statement: Clearly define the business problem and how the data project helps to solve it. Key Findings: Highlight the most important findings from the data that are relevant to the business problem. Business Impact: Discuss how the findings can be used to drive business decisions and the potential impact on the business. Actionable Recommendations: Provide clear next steps based on the findings. Using the same customer churn model, I might discuss why customer churn is a critical issue, the key factors that contribute to customer churn according to the model (like customer complaints or usage patterns), how reducing churn can improve revenue, and suggest strategies to reduce churn (like improving customer service or offering usage-based incentives).\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","## Evaluation Report:\n","\n","1. **How would you demonstrate the ability to turn data insight into business value in a real-world scenario?
